# What is a Server

In simple terms, a server is a computer or a system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network, such as the internet.

## Example:
Imagine you open a web browser and type in a website address like www.example.com. When you press enter:

Your computer (the client) sends a request to the server where that website is stored.
The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back the data (like the website's HTML, images, etc.).
Your browser then displays that data as a website.
Key Points About a Server:
It listens for requests: A server is always ready to receive requests from clients (e.g., your web browser, a mobile app).

It provides services or data: When a client makes a request (e.g., asking for a webpage, uploading a file), the server processes that request and responds with the appropriate data.

It can be physical or virtual: A server can be a physical computer, but in many cases, itâ€™s a virtual server (a piece of software that acts like a physical server) running in the cloud.

# Different types of servers:

1. Web server: Serves websites (like when you visit a webpage).
2. Database server: Stores and manages databases.
3. File server: Stores and shares files across a network.
## Real-Life Analogy:
Think of a server as a restaurant.

You (the client) go to the restaurant and request (order) food.
The restaurant (server) takes your request, prepares the food, and brings it to you.
Similarly, a server takes requests (like asking for a website), processes them, and sends back what you need (like the HTML to display the page).
In the case of a web server, it serves websites. You (the client) request a webpage, and the server sends the webpage to your browser.
