# What does app.use() do in simple words?
In Express.js (a Node.js framework), `app.use()` is a function that lets you add middleware to your application.

# What is middleware?
Middleware is a function or a set of functions that run between receiving a request and sending a response. These functions can modify the request, add extra data, handle errors, or even stop the request from continuing.

Think of it like a checkpoint in the process of handling requests. The server checks or processes something (like authentication, logging, etc.) before moving to the next step.

# How app.use() works:
Middleware can be used for things like logging requests, handling errors, or parsing incoming data (like JSON, form data, or cookies).
`app.use()` lets you apply this middleware to your application, telling it what middleware to use and when.
### Example 1:
 Logging Middleware
Hereâ€™s an example of using app.use() to log every request:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware that logs every request
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, Request URL: ${req.url}`);
  next();  // Move on to the next middleware or route handler
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```
In this example:

`app.use()` adds a middleware function that logs every request.
The next() function tells Express to continue to the next step, whether it's more middleware or a route handler.

### Example 2: 

Using `app.use()` for body parsing (to handle incoming JSON data)

When you submit a form or send JSON data in a request, app.use() can be used to automatically parse that data:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON data
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);  // This will contain the parsed JSON data
  res.send('Data received');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
In this example:

`app.use(express.json())` is middleware that parses incoming JSON requests, so you can easily access the data using req.body.

## Summary:
`app.use()` is used to add middleware to your Express app.
Middleware is like a helper function that processes requests before reaching your routes.

You can use `app.use()` to add features like logging, parsing data, handling errors, etc.
