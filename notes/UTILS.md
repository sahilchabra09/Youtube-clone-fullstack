# Why do we make a utils folder?
The utils folder is typically created in a project to store utility functions. These are small, reusable pieces of code that perform common tasks and can be shared across different parts of the project. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you write it once in the utils folder and use it wherever you need.

## Real-life analogy:
Imagine you're organizing a kitchen. Instead of keeping multiple knives scattered all over the kitchen, you store them in one utility drawer. Whenever you need a knife, you just open the drawer and grab one. Similarly, utility functions are stored in the utils folder, and you "grab" (import) them whenever you need to use them.

## Example:
Let's say you have a function that formats dates. Instead of repeating the same code in different files, you create a utils/dateFormatter.js file and define the function there:

```
// utils/dateFormatter.js
export const formatDate = (date) => {
  // Code to format the date
  return formattedDate;
};
```
Now, any time you need to format a date, you just import and use the formatDate function from your utils folder. It helps organize code better and avoids duplication.

## Explanation of the code:
The code you provided is an asyncHandler function. Its purpose is to handle asynchronous operations in Express route handlers and catch any errors, so you don’t have to write repetitive try-catch blocks in every route.

Let’s break down the code in simple terms:

```
const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        // Execute the request handler and catch any errors
        Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)).catch((err) => next(err));
    };
};

export { asyncHandler };
```
**asyncHandler**: This is a higher-order function, which means it takes a function (requestHandler) as an argument and returns a new function.

**(req, res, next)**: This is the signature for a typical Express route handler (handling the request, response, and passing errors to next()).

**Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)):** This executes the requestHandler (the function passed to asyncHandler) and makes sure it returns a Promise. If the function is already an async function, it will work as expected. If it's not, this ensures it's treated as one.

**.catch((err) => next(err)):** If there’s an error during the execution of the requestHandler, it catches the error and passes it to next(err) to be handled by Express’s error-handling middleware.

## What does this code solve?
When dealing with asynchronous code in Express, you need to use try-catch blocks to handle errors. Without the asyncHandler, you would have to do something like this in every route:
```
app.get('/route', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const data = await someAsyncFunction();
        res.send(data);
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);  // Pass error to Express error handler
    }
});
```
With the asyncHandler, you can simplify the code:

```
app.get('/route', asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
    const data = await someAsyncFunction();
    res.send(data);
}));
```
The asyncHandler automatically handles the try-catch for you.

Now, for the versions of asyncHandler you provided:
Empty asyncHandler:
javascript
Copy code
const asyncHandler = () => {};
This is a placeholder function that does nothing. It’s just an empty function.

asyncHandler with a single argument but no implementation:
javascript
Copy code
const asyncHandler = (func) => () => {};
Here, func is passed as an argument, but the returned function doesn’t do anything yet.

asyncHandler returning an async function:
javascript
Copy code
const asyncHandler = (func) => async () => {};
This version sets up an asynchronous function (async) that will execute func inside it, but right now, the func isn’t being called yet.

Full asyncHandler with try-catch for error handling:
javascript
Copy code
const asyncHandler = (fn) => async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        await fn(req, res, next);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(err.code || 500).json({
            success: false,
            message: err.message
        });
    }
};
This version does the same thing as the original, but instead of passing the error to next(err) (which would let Express handle the error), it handles the error inside the catch block by sending a response with an error status and message.

await fn(req, res, next): Executes the passed-in route handler.
catch (err): If there's an error, it sends a JSON response with the error message and a status code (err.code or 500 if not specified).
Real-life analogy for asyncHandler:
Think of asyncHandler like a safety net for someone walking on a high wire (which represents your route handler).

Without the safety net (asyncHandler), if the person (route handler) makes a mistake (throws an error), they’ll fall to the ground (the app will crash or hang).
With the safety net (asyncHandler), if they fall, the net catches them (the error is handled and passed to the next middleware), so they don’t hit the ground.
This way, your route handlers don't need to worry about managing errors all the time, and the app can handle them smoothly.

Summary of Key Points:
utils folder: It’s a place to store reusable helper functions (like asyncHandler), keeping your project organized and avoiding code duplication.

asyncHandler: This function helps manage errors in async route handlers, so you don’t need to write try-catch blocks every time. It catches errors and forwards them to Express’s error-handling mechanism.
